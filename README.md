# Marker-macOS
### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/XFhOsGJZ0tk

Hello!.  
This is CS50's final project by Mohammad Mohab (me XD).  

So marker is a macOS app that can generate barcodes either manually or automatically.  

##Manual generation:  
Manual generation is by handing an input to marker wich can a combination of characters, numbers and a dash!, And you can still specify the width and height of the barcode.  

###Both the manual and auto generations can be specified the width and the height of the barcode and can be made to be human readable by showing a lable  
of the barcode value and the font size of that lable can be specified!.  

##Automatic generation:
Automatic generation is by specifing an amount and a length of the generated value, then specify the size and font settings, then hit save wich shows  
a save panel to choose the saving location then marker would save all the generated barcodes to the specified location each of which is named as the value of the barcode it self.  

##This was mohammad from marker and this is cs50.
