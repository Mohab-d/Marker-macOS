### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/XFhOsGJZ0tk

Hello!  
This is CS50's final project by Mohammad Mohab (me XD).  

So marker is a macOS app that can generate barcodes either manually or automatically.  

##Manual generation:  
Manual generation is by handing an input to marker which can be a combination of characters, numbers and a dash!, And you can still specify the width and height of the barcode.  

###Both the manual and auto generations can be specified the width and the height of the barcode and can be made to be human readable by showing a lable  
of the barcode value underneeth the barcode itself and the font size of that lable can be specified!.  

##Automatic generation:
Automatic generation is by specifing an amount and a length of the generated value, then specify the size and font settings, hit save wich shows  
a save panel to choose the saving location then marker would save all generated barcodes to the specified location each of which is named as the value of the barcode itself  

##This was mohammad from marker and this is cs50.
